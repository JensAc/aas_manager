Needs:
    For TypeOptionGroupBox: - Abstract classes must be really abstract!
                            - Some datatypes must be implemented (Time, Duration etc.)!
    For testing Open/Save: - read_aas_json_file() doesn't work for str files
                              with open(file, "r") as f:
                                self.objStore = aasx.read_aas_json_file(f)

Suggestions:
    - Make Submodel iterable which consists of submodel elements.
        Represeation of Submodel in left TreeView is not real.
        SubmodelElement should be element of Submodel but it is Element of list submodel_element

Fragen:
_kind in Submodel, warum mit Unterstrich vorne?


Bugs:
    Repr in AASReference wants to get __name__, but type is sometimes ForwardRef
        which doesnt have __name__ but it has __forward_arg__
    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return "AASReference(type={}, key={})".format(self.type.__name__, self.key)
