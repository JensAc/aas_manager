Needs:
    For TypeOptionGroupBox: - Some datatypes must be implemented (Time, Duration etc.)!
    For testing Open/Save: - read_aas_json_file() doesn't work for str files
                              with open(file, "r") as f:
                                self.objStore = aasx.read_aas_json_file(f)

Suggestions:
- target_type parameter in init of AASReference must have same name as class attribute

Fragen:
- _kind in Submodel, warum mit Unterstrich vorne?
- will keys 'type_' and 'local' stay in Key? (Bug bei add item, because of Type[~RT]

Bugs:
    Repr in AASReference wants to get __name__, but type is sometimes ForwardRef
        which doesnt have __name__ but it has __forward_arg__
    def __repr__(self) -> str:
        return "AASReference(type={}, key={})".format(self.type.__name__, self.key)
